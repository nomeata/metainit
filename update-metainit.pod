=head1 NAME

update-metainit - Generates init scripts

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<update-metainit> [B<--remove> I<initname> [B<--purge>] ]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

I<Metainit> solves the problem of writing good init scripts. Instead
of manually creating these important files, they are derived from a declaritive description in the metainit files in I</etc/metainit>. These files can be shipped with packages or created by the local administrator.  

If B<update-metainit> called without argument, it will regenerate init scripts for all the files in I</etc/metainit>. The generated files contain a large warning
in form of a comment that they will be overridden. Modifications are
preferably done in the files in I</etc/metainit> and made effective by
running B<update-metainit>. If needed, the administrator can prevent
modified init files by removing the warning comment.

=head1 OPTIONS
